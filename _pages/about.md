I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Weiyang College](https://www.wyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I'm pursuing a double-major degree, including Mathematics & Physics and Electrical Engineering & Automation. My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and AI.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Feng Shuo](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1091/3009.htm) from [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm), Tsinghua University.
